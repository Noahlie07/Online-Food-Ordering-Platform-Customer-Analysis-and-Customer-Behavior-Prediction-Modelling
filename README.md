# Online-Food-Ordering-Platform-Customer-Analysis-and-Customer-Behavior-Prediction-Modelling
Utilized R programming to engineer a detailed Customer Demographic and Feedback Analysis project, focusing on Machine Learning with the development of a Random Forest predictive model to predict customer behavior.

## Purpose of This Project
This project serves as a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior based on data from an online food ordering service. This project focuses on understanding demographic trends, analyzing customer feedback, and developing a predictive model capable of forecasting customer reordering probabilities.  

The overarching goal of this project is to employ machine learning algorithms to determine whether a customer would likely reorder based on their demographic background and order details.


## Overview of This Project
This project is structured around three core components:

1. **Demographic Analysis**: conducting basic demographic analysis to comprehend who exactly are the customers  
2. **Customer Feedback Analysis**: analyzing feedback from customers over different demographics  
3. **Predictive Modelling**: employing random forest modelling to predict customer behavior - whether they are likely to reorder or not

## Skills Demonstrated
Skills: R programming language, ggplot2/tidyverse/common libraries used for tidying data and creating graphs, Machine Learning

## Accessing The Project
Open "OnlineFoodOrdering.R" to take a look at the code involved for this project. "Online Food Ordering Project.Rmd" is an R markdown file documenting the project, it includes rundown of the code involved int he project and conclusions derived from the results of the project.
